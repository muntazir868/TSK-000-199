## Fraud Detection
 Apply machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent activities or transactions.
 Gather and preprocess relevant data, including historical transaction records,
user profiles, or network logs.
 Extract meaningful features from the data, such as transaction amount, location,
user behavior patterns, or network traffic.
 Train a fraud detection model, such as logistic regression, random forest, or
anomaly detection algorithms.
 Evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics and continuously
update it with new data to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.
